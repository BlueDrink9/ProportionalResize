DESCRIPTION
When Vim itself is resized, the rightmost and bottom windows receive or lose
the change in size; all other windows maintain their size as long as possible.
What you usually want is that _all_ window heights and widths are adapted, so
that the proportions of the windows remain constant.

This plugin defines a :ProportionalResize command that wraps Ex commands
like
    :set lines=40 columns=80
    :simalt ~m
    :Fullscreen
and scales the window sizes to the new dimensions. It also records the window
layout during brief pauses and is then able to auto-adapt after spontaneous
resizings through the mouse or window manager.

SOURCE
Inspired by the following Stack Overflow question:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14649698/how-to-resize-split-windows-in-vim-proportionally

USAGE
:ProportionalResize {resize-cmd}
                        Execute {resize-cmd} (e.g. :setlocal lines=40) and
                        adapt the proportions of the current window layout to
                        the new size. So if for example you have 3 windows
                        split vertically 1:1:2, and a horizontal split 4:1,
                        the proportions will be kept instead of the rightmost
                        and bottom windows getting all the space increases.

:NoProportionalResize {resize-cmd}
                        Execute {resize-cmd} (e.g. :setlocal lines=40) without
                        adapting the proportions of the current window layout.
                        You can wrap commands which would confuse the plugin's
                        algorithm (e.g. a rotate function that switches
                        vertical with horizontal windows), so that it won't
                        automatically adapt the window layout.
